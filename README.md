# CityInfo üèô

As part of the course 'Web Applications IV' we were asked to build a website using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js). This project is a website masonry to master the Angular framework.
The website allows users to choose a region and then post messages for just that region (similar to a Facebook group for your municipality). The user can also post comments on messages from other users.

## Link

This project is running on [Heroku](https://cityinfo-frontend.herokuapp.com/).

_P.S .: If the link no longer functions, the website has been taken offline._

## Account information

You can test the project with the following dummy account:

- **Username**: `web4`
- **Password**: `gelukkiggeennetbeans`

If problems occur you can always mail to [jakob.lierman@student.hogent.be](mailto:jakob.lierman@student.hogent.be?SUBJECT=CityInfo).
